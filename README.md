# Voter Identification Portal - Backend

A blockchain-based voter identification system that securely registers and verifies voters using Ethereum smart contracts.

## 🔗 Where and Why Blockchain is Used

### **Where Blockchain is Used:**

1. **Voter Registration Storage**
   - All voter registrations are permanently stored on the Ethereum blockchain
   - Each voter gets a unique blockchain address as their identifier
   - Voter data is immutably recorded in smart contracts

2. **Verification Process**
   - Admin verification actions are recorded as blockchain transactions
   - Verification status changes are permanently logged on-chain
   - Creates an audit trail that cannot be tampered with

3. **Data Integrity**
   - Voter details, verification status, and timestamps are stored on-chain
   - Smart contracts enforce business rules (only admins can verify)
   - Blockchain acts as the single source of truth for voter status

### **Why Blockchain is Used:**

1. **Immutability** 🔒
   - Once a voter is registered or verified, the record cannot be altered or deleted
   - Prevents electoral fraud and manipulation of voter records
   - Creates permanent, tamper-proof voter database

2. **Transparency** 👁️
   - All transactions are publicly verifiable on the blockchain
   - Anyone can audit the voter registration and verification process
   - Builds public trust in the electoral system

3. **Decentralization** 🌐
   - No single authority controls the voter database
   - Reduces dependency on centralized systems that can fail or be compromised
   - Distributes trust across the blockchain network

4. **Auditability** 📊
   - Complete history of all voter registrations and verifications
   - Chronological record of admin actions with timestamps
   - Enables post-election auditing and verification

5. **Security** 🛡️
   - Cryptographic security prevents unauthorized modifications
   - Admin-only functions enforced by smart contract code
   - Eliminates single points of failure

### **Blockchain vs Traditional Database:**

| Aspect | Blockchain | Traditional Database |
|--------|------------|---------------------|
| **Immutability** | ✅ Cannot be changed | ❌ Can be modified/deleted |
| **Transparency** | ✅ Publicly verifiable | ❌ Requires trust in operator |
| **Decentralization** | ✅ Distributed control | ❌ Centralized control |
| **Audit Trail** | ✅ Complete history | ⚠️ Can be manipulated |
| **Downtime Risk** | ✅ No single point of failure | ❌ Server dependency |

### **Smart Contract Functions:**

- **`registerVoter()`**: Records voter details on blockchain
- **`verifyVoter()`**: Admin function to verify registered voters
- **`isVoterVerified()`**: Check verification status from blockchain
- **`getVoterDetails()`**: Retrieve voter information from blockchain

## 🔧 Nitty-Gritty: How Blockchain is Implemented

### **Smart Contract Architecture**

#### **Contract Structure (Solidity)**
```solidity
contract VoterRegistry {
    address public admin;
    
    struct Voter {
        string name;
        string aadharHash;     // Hashed Aadhar number for privacy
        string dobHash;        // Hashed date of birth
        string addressHash;    // Hashed residential address
        bool isVerified;       // Verification status
        uint256 registrationTime;
        uint256 verificationTime;
        bool exists;           // Check if voter exists
    }
    
    mapping(address => Voter) public voters;
    address[] public voterAddresses;
    
    event VoterRegistered(address indexed voterAddress, uint256 timestamp);
    event VoterVerified(address indexed voterAddress, address indexed admin, uint256 timestamp);
}
```

#### **Key Smart Contract Functions:**

1. **`registerVoter()`** - Stores voter data on blockchain
```solidity
function registerVoter(
    address _voterAddress,
    string memory _name,
    string memory _aadharHash,
    string memory _dobHash,
    string memory _addressHash
) public {
    require(!voters[_voterAddress].exists, "Voter already registered");
    
    voters[_voterAddress] = Voter({
        name: _name,
        aadharHash: _aadharHash,
        dobHash: _dobHash,
        addressHash: _addressHash,
        isVerified: false,
        registrationTime: block.timestamp,
        verificationTime: 0,
        exists: true
    });
    
    voterAddresses.push(_voterAddress);
    emit VoterRegistered(_voterAddress, block.timestamp);
}
```

2. **`verifyVoter()`** - Admin-only verification
```solidity
function verifyVoter(address _voterAddress) public onlyAdmin {
    require(voters[_voterAddress].exists, "Voter not registered");
    require(!voters[_voterAddress].isVerified, "Voter already verified");
    
    voters[_voterAddress].isVerified = true;
    voters[_voterAddress].verificationTime = block.timestamp;
    
    emit VoterVerified(_voterAddress, msg.sender, block.timestamp);
}
```

### **Backend Implementation Details**

#### **1. Blockchain Connection Setup**
```javascript
// blockchain/connection.js
const { ethers } = require('ethers');

class BlockchainConnection {
    constructor() {
        // Connect to blockchain network
        this.provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(
            process.env.SEPOLIA_RPC_URL || 'http://127.0.0.1:8545'
        );
        
        // Create wallet instance for admin operations
        this.adminWallet = new ethers.Wallet(
            process.env.PRIVATE_KEY,
            this.provider
        );
        
        // Load contract ABI and address
        this.contractAddress = process.env.CONTRACT_ADDRESS;
        this.contractABI = require('../artifacts/contracts/VoterRegistry.sol/VoterRegistry.json').abi;
        
        // Create contract instance
        this.contract = new ethers.Contract(
            this.contractAddress,
            this.contractABI,
            this.adminWallet
        );
    }
}
```

#### **2. Voter Registration Process**
```javascript
// services/voterService.js
async function registerVoterOnBlockchain(voterData) {
    try {
        // Step 1: Hash sensitive data before storing on blockchain
        const aadharHash = ethers.keccak256(ethers.toUtf8Bytes(voterData.aadharNumber));
        const dobHash = ethers.keccak256(ethers.toUtf8Bytes(voterData.dob));
        const addressHash = ethers.keccak256(ethers.toUtf8Bytes(voterData.residentialAddress));
        
        // Step 2: Call smart contract function
        const transaction = await blockchainConnection.contract.registerVoter(
            voterData.address,        // Voter's Ethereum address
            voterData.name,           // Plain text name
            aadharHash,               // Hashed Aadhar
            dobHash,                  // Hashed DOB
            addressHash               // Hashed address
        );
        
        // Step 3: Wait for transaction confirmation
        const receipt = await transaction.wait();
        
        // Step 4: Extract event data
        const event = receipt.logs.find(log => 
            log.topics[0] === ethers.id("VoterRegistered(address,uint256)")
        );
        
        return {
            success: true,
            transactionHash: receipt.hash,
            blockNumber: receipt.blockNumber,
            gasUsed: receipt.gasUsed.toString(),
            registrationTime: new Date(parseInt(event.args[1]) * 1000)
        };
        
    } catch (error) {
        throw new Error(`Blockchain registration failed: ${error.message}`);
    }
}
```

#### **3. Voter Verification Process**
```javascript
async function verifyVoterOnBlockchain(adminAddress, voterAddress) {
    try {
        // Step 1: Verify admin permissions
        const contractAdmin = await blockchainConnection.contract.admin();
        if (adminAddress.toLowerCase() !== contractAdmin.toLowerCase()) {
            throw new Error('Unauthorized: Only admin can verify voters');
        }
        
        // Step 2: Check if voter exists and is unverified
        const voterData = await blockchainConnection.contract.voters(voterAddress);
        if (!voterData.exists) {
            throw new Error('Voter not found on blockchain');
        }
        if (voterData.isVerified) {
            throw new Error('Voter already verified');
        }
        
        // Step 3: Execute verification transaction
        const transaction = await blockchainConnection.contract.verifyVoter(voterAddress);
        const receipt = await transaction.wait();
        
        // Step 4: Extract verification event
        const event = receipt.logs.find(log => 
            log.topics[0] === ethers.id("VoterVerified(address,address,uint256)")
        );
        
        return {
            success: true,
            transactionHash: receipt.hash,
            verificationTime: new Date(parseInt(event.args[2]) * 1000),
            gasUsed: receipt.gasUsed.toString()
        };
        
    } catch (error) {
        throw new Error(`Verification failed: ${error.message}`);
    }
}
```

#### **4. Data Retrieval from Blockchain**
```javascript
async function getVoterFromBlockchain(voterAddress) {
    try {
        // Query smart contract directly
        const voterData = await blockchainConnection.contract.voters(voterAddress);
        
        if (!voterData.exists) {
            return null;
        }
        
        return {
            name: voterData.name,
            isVerified: voterData.isVerified,
            registrationTime: new Date(parseInt(voterData.registrationTime) * 1000),
            verificationTime: voterData.verificationTime > 0 
                ? new Date(parseInt(voterData.verificationTime) * 1000) 
                : null,
            // Note: Hashed data cannot be retrieved in plain text
            aadharHash: voterData.aadharHash,
            dobHash: voterData.dobHash,
            addressHash: voterData.addressHash
        };
    } catch (error) {
        throw new Error(`Failed to retrieve voter data: ${error.message}`);
    }
}
```

### **API Endpoint Implementation**

#### **Registration Endpoint**
```javascript
// routes/voters.js
app.post('/api/voters/register', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        // Step 1: Validate input data
        const { address, name, aadharNumber, dob, residentialAddress } = req.body;
        
        // Step 2: Check if voter already exists on blockchain
        const existingVoter = await getVoterFromBlockchain(address);
        if (existingVoter) {
            return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Voter already registered' });
        }
        
        // Step 3: Register on blockchain
        const blockchainResult = await registerVoterOnBlockchain({
            address,
            name,
            aadharNumber,
            dob,
            residentialAddress
        });
        
        // Step 4: Store additional data in MongoDB (off-chain)
        const mongoVoter = await Voter.create({
            blockchainAddress: address,
            encryptedData: encrypt(JSON.stringify({
                phoneNumber: req.body.phoneNumber,
                email: req.body.email,
                aadharImageUrl: req.body.aadharImageUrl
            })),
            district: `${req.body.city}, ${req.body.state}`,
            gender: req.body.gender,
            createdAt: blockchainResult.registrationTime
        });
        
        res.status(201).json({
            message: 'Voter registered successfully',
            blockchainAddress: address,
            blockchainTxHash: blockchainResult.transactionHash,
            onBlockchain: true,
            gasUsed: blockchainResult.gasUsed
        });
        
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).json({ 
            error: 'Registration failed', 
            details: error.message 
        });
    }
});
```

### **Transaction Flow Diagram**

```
Registration Flow:
User Input → API Validation → Hash Sensitive Data → Smart Contract Call → 
Blockchain Transaction → Wait for Confirmation → Store Metadata in MongoDB → 
Return Success Response

Verification Flow:
Admin Request → Verify Admin Permissions → Check Voter Exists → 
Smart Contract verifyVoter() → Blockchain Transaction → 
Event Emission → Update Local Database → Return Confirmation

Query Flow:
API Request → Smart Contract Query → Blockchain State Read → 
Combine with MongoDB Data → Return Combined Response
```

### **Gas Optimization Strategies**

1. **Batch Operations**: Group multiple registrations in single transaction
2. **Data Hashing**: Store only hashes of sensitive data on-chain
3. **Event Logs**: Use events for historical data instead of storage
4. **Efficient Storage**: Pack struct data to minimize storage slots

### **Security Measures**

1. **Access Control**: `onlyAdmin` modifier for verification functions
2. **Input Validation**: Require statements in smart contract
3. **Reentrancy Protection**: Use OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard
4. **Data Privacy**: Hash sensitive information before blockchain storage

### **Error Handling**

```javascript
// Blockchain-specific error handling
function handleBlockchainError(error) {
    if (error.code === 'INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS') {
        return 'Insufficient ETH for transaction fees';
    } else if (error.code === 'NETWORK_ERROR') {
        return 'Blockchain network connectivity issue';
    } else if (error.reason) {
        return `Smart contract error: ${error.reason}`;
    } else {
        return 'Unknown blockchain error occurred';
    }
}
```

### **Monitoring and Analytics**

```javascript
// Event listening for real-time updates
blockchainConnection.contract.on('VoterRegistered', (voterAddress, timestamp, event) => {
    console.log(`New voter registered: ${voterAddress} at ${new Date(timestamp * 1000)}`);
    // Update local cache/database
    updateLocalVoterCache(voterAddress);
});

blockchainConnection.contract.on('VoterVerified', (voterAddress, admin, timestamp, event) => {
    console.log(`Voter ${voterAddress} verified by ${admin}`);
    // Send notification, update UI, etc.
    notifyVoterVerification(voterAddress);
});
```

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide for Beginners

### Prerequisites

You'll need to install these tools before you begin:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (comes with Node.js)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (optional, for cloning the repository)

### Step 1: Clone or Download the Project

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd myvote-backend
```

Or download and extract the ZIP file if you don't have Git.

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Open a terminal/command prompt in the project folder and run:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the required packages.

### Step 3: Set Up Ganache (Local Blockchain)

1. Install Ganache globally:

   ```bash
   npm install -g ganache
   ```

2. Start Ganache:

   ```bash
   ganache
   ```

3. You'll see a list of accounts and private keys. Copy the address and private key of the first account (this will be your admin account).

### Step 4: Create Environment Variables

1. Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project
2. Add the following content:

```
PORT=5000
PRIVATE_KEY=paste_your_ganache_private_key_here
ADMIN_ADDRESS=paste_your_ganache_address_here
```

Replace the placeholders with:

- `paste_your_ganache_private_key_here`: The private key from Ganache (starts with 0x)
- `paste_your_ganache_address_here`: The address from Ganache (starts with 0x)

### Step 5: Deploy the Smart Contract

1. Compile the smart contract:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. Deploy the smart contract to your local Ganache blockchain:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network ganache
   ```

   **What happens here:** This deploys your voter registration smart contract to the blockchain, creating an immutable voter database.

3. You'll see a message with the contract address. Copy this address.

4. Add the contract address to your `.env` file:
   ```
   CONTRACT_ADDRESS=paste_your_contract_address_here
   ```

### Step 6: Start the Backend Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see a message indicating that the server is running on http://localhost:5000.

## 📚 API Documentation

### Authentication

Most admin endpoints require authentication using the admin Ethereum address. Include the admin address in the request headers:

```
x-admin-address: 0x6E5ceE75158A189939F6d945351dBD86370672AD
```

### Voter Endpoints

#### Register a Voter

```http
POST /api/voters/register
```

**What happens on blockchain:** This creates a permanent, immutable record of the voter on the Ethereum blockchain with verification status set to false.

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "address": "0x851BdD62Fd471a652CCFb4a0aa65E41e33B0508C",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "gender": "Male",
  "dob": "1990-01-01",
  "city": "Mumbai",
  "state": "Maharashtra",
  "aadharNumber": "123456789012",
  "phoneNumber": "9876543210",
  "email": "johndoe@example.com",
  "aadharImageUrl": "/uploads/example.png"
}
```

**Another Example:**

```json
{
  "address": "0x742d35Cc7B7d8932B8D74E8E32C3e8B5F9C8A1D6",
  "name": "Priya Sharma",
  "gender": "Female",
  "dob": "1995-06-15",
  "city": "Delhi",
  "state": "Delhi",
  "aadharNumber": "987654321098",
  "phoneNumber": "8765432109",
  "email": "priya.sharma@example.com",
  "aadharImageUrl": "/uploads/priya_aadhar.png"
}
```

**Response (Success - 201):**

```json
{
  "message": "Voter registered successfully",
  "blockchainAddress": "0x851BdD62Fd471a652CCFb4a0aa65E41e33B0508C",
  "blockchainTxHash": "0xa1b2c3d4e5f6...",
  "onBlockchain": true,
  "gasUsed": "284567"
}
```

**Response Fields Explanation:**
- `message`: Operation status message
- `blockchainAddress`: Voter's Ethereum wallet address
- `blockchainTxHash`: Blockchain transaction hash (null if blockchain write failed)
- `onBlockchain`: Boolean indicating if data was written to blockchain
- `gasUsed`: Amount of gas consumed for the blockchain transaction

**⚠️ Troubleshooting:**
If you see `"blockchainTxHash": null` and `"onBlockchain": false`, it means:
- Voter data was saved to MongoDB only
- Blockchain transaction failed (check contract address, network connection, gas settings)
- Admin private key or contract ABI might be incorrect

**Response (Error - 400/500):**

```json
{
  "error": "Error message",
  "details": "Detailed error information"
}
```

#### Verify a Voter (Admin Only)
